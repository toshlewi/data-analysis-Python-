# Iris Dataset Analysis Assignment

## Overview
This assignment demonstrates the use of Python for data loading, cleaning, analysis, and visualization using the Iris dataset.

## Tools Used
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn (for dataset)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Contents
- Iris_Data_Analysis_Assignment.ipynb: A complete Jupyter notebook with:
  - Data loading and exploration
  - Basic descriptive analysis
  - Group-wise statistical summaries
  - Visualizations (line chart, bar chart, histogram, scatter plot)

## How to Use
1. Open the notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab.
2. Run the cells in order to view the outputs.
3. Use File > Download As > PDF in Jupyter if needed for PDF conversion.

## Visualizations Included
- Line chart: Cumulative Sepal Length over sample index
- Bar chart: Average Petal Length per species
- Histogram: Sepal Width distribution
- Scatter plot: Sepal Length vs Petal Length (colored by species)

## Observations
- Setosa species shows distinctly smaller petal sizes.
- Virginica and Versicolor are more similar in petal measurements.
